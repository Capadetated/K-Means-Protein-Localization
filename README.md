# K-Means-Protein-Localization
K-Means Clustering Analysis on Protein Localization Sites

This R-based project used a K-Means Clustering program to find patterns within a protein localization dataset. The dataset was taken from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ecoli. 

"Assignment5_Fitch.PDF" contains the full written report on the topic. "Assignment5_Fitch.R" contains the code to perform the analysis. "ecoli.csv" contains the dataset and "ecoli.txt" contains the key to the data.
